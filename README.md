MVP_codelearn_Dtree is the ML code using Decision Tree. It is used with two CSV files - Airbus_Part_numbers_Features.csv and Airbus_Part_numbersDTree.csv.
The Dtree contains the different part numbers, and the 'part_code', which shows the different types of part numbers. 
Features have been extracted against each part number, in the Features file. These features are used to train the model.
